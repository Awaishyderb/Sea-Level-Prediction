# Sea Level Regression Model
This project involves creating a simple regression model to analyze and predict sea levels using historical data. The dataset contains dates and Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) values. The model is capable of predicting future sea levels, with a particular focus on projections around the year 2050.

# Project Overview
The aim of this project is to create a regression model to study the trend in sea level changes and make future predictions. The project involves:

Loading and preprocessing the sea level dataset.
Training a simple linear regression model.
Evaluating the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Predicting future sea levels, specifically around the year 2050.
Visualizing the results.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains two columns:

Date: The date of the recorded sea level measurement.
GMSL: The Global Mean Sea Level value.
